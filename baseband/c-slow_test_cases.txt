C-Slow Test Cases

Simple Subsystem (not enabled)
	Delays multiplied by share factor and not rewired.  No Rewireing

Simple System including Enabled Subsystem
	Delays not in enabled subsystem multiplied by share_factor and not re-wired.
	Enable line re-wired to new en input
	Delays inside of enabled subsystem = 0, removed
	Delays inside of enabled subsystem > 1, replaced with c-slow shift register
		Replaced block properly wired
		Enable wired to en port.

Simple Enabled Subsystem multiple blocks connected to delay ouput
    Ensure all block are connected to replacement (if delay >0) or source (if delay == 0)
